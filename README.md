# AccountManager
A program that keeps track of all your accounts - the emails you use, usernames, and passwords.

### NuGet Packages:
> Dapper  
> System.Data.SqlClient  
> Microsoft.Extentions.Configurations.Abstractions

### To Create Your Own Database:
> In VisualStudio - Right click on the database project (AccountManagerDB) and click 'Publish' then click edit in the 'Target database connection' then go to the 'browse' tab then click local and select the MSSQLLocalDB. This connects you to a a local database within Visual Studio (you might need to install database tools for VS). Lastly if you going to build and deploy the application hit publish and you are all set.
